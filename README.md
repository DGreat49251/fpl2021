# Checking player performance
Before you start building your team, it is important that you do extensive research on the players. 
If you want to win, your players must have a really good performance streak in the recent matches.This increases your chance of winning too. 
If you take in a few in-form players who have performed well in the past few months, you will not be disappointed with the outcome.

# Analyzing the weather report and pitch
This analysis is something that most participants don’t pay attention to. The pitch and the weather have an impact on the day’s match. 
If the pitch is dry and the match is held in the afternoon, then it is always better to pick spinners. In the case of a humid climate,
picking swing bowlers over spinners will always work in your favor. Even though this is not something that participants pay attention to,
taking into consideration these minute details is one of the things that increases your chances of winning.
